This dataset is essential for wildfire analysis and research in Azerbaijan. Since such a project had never been done in Azerbaijan before, creating a database was challenging and had to be done from scratch. The dataset can be downloaded as a .zip file that includes one folder with images and a CSV file containing comprehensive metadata about the collected images.",

        "p2": "The team specializes in software development, data visualization, and project management, contributing their unique skills to deliver this impactful solution. Ahmad worked on visualization, Gunel on data processing, Sahil on synthetic wildfire image creation and website design, and Turgay on developing a wildfire detection model from satellite imagery."

It provides users with the ability to filter wildfire images by region, time, satellite type, and other criteria. The platform's interactive map and user-friendly design make it a valuable resource for researchers, environmentalists, and policymakers.",
