Since the preparation of a database on forest fires in Azerbaijan has never been realized so far, it was quite difficult for us as a team to find any resource. However, thanks to NASA's global work in this field, we tried to fill the gap in this field in Azerbaijan by working with the information they sent us. When the data was collected and sent from the other side, files in CSV and PNG formats were provided to us. We were able to combine these separately submitted files and provide the main page of this website with relevant information. In addition, the images presented on the main page, individually or optionally filtered, can be downloaded to any user's device upon reading and accepting the MIT License. The files downloaded in ZIP format consist of both the image and the details of that fire image. The images are completely open to all users, along with their specific information. You can see the images presented below as two examples. You can view our general database of over 500 images by clicking on the “Hugging Face” link.",

The team members not only worked on visually presenting the obtained data in a clear manner, but also made efforts to develop models for automatically detecting forest fires using artificial intelligence.",
        "p2": "As a team, we believe that this database of images, which shows different but high results with different models, will play a supporting role in the immediate detection and prevention of fire disasters in Azerbaijan in the future using artificial satellites."

      "project": {
        "h2": "Project",
        "p": "This project draws attention to the advantage of satellite-based detection of forest fires, which have increased in recent years. Immediate detection and control of fires caused by human or non-human causes not only minimizes the damage to nature, but also prevents economic and social consequences. Considering that our country's geographically mountainous zones cover large areas, fires that have occurred in areas that cannot be seen or controlled by human forces can be easily detected using satellites, and relevant agencies can be notified of such events. By presenting images of forest fires that have occurred in recent years without any restrictions or limits, our project creates a basis for Azerbaijan to move in parallel with countries in the world that have just started working on this topic. While academic researchers who have worked on similar topics simply collect the images they obtain in a database and present them in a closed manner, our project is a world first by presenting the images directly on the main page without any user login requirements.",
        "projectInfo": "This project, which does not address a specific audience, serves to both raise awareness about natural disasters and show solutions to these natural disasters by freely presenting this information to a very large audience. Our website, which allows users to filter, sort, and download information according to details such as region, date, etc., also helps local and foreign organizations, whether dependent on us or not, to benefit from this open source by openly displaying their codes and the files they use. We believe that if work in this field increases in the future, this collection of information we display will be useful to everyone."
