    <!-- About Dataset Section -->
    <section id="about-dataset">
        <h2>Dataset</h2>
        <p>
            The dataset contains wildfire images collected from satellite sources and includes metadata such as
            acquisition dates, regions, satellite names, and instruments used. This dataset is essential for wildfire
            analysis and research in Azerbaijan. Since such a project had never been done in Azerbaijan before, creating
            a database was challenging and had to be done from scratch.
            Firstly the team contacted related organizations from Azerbaijan to gather any data that might contribute to
            the project however there were no results.
            Later the team requested NASA FIRMS fire alerts from multiple satellite instruments to get geospatial data
            for detecting fire events. NASA sent csv
            Sentinel-2 satellite imagery corresponding to fire alerts was extracted, with the QA band applied for cloud
            masking and RGB bands used to display the final image.
            The processing pipeline was optimized to handle over 10,700 fire alerts concurrently. Finally, images were
            manually labeled based on visible fire plumes and smoke patterns to provide ground truth data for future
            model training and validation.
            The dataset contains 582 images which are 512x512. Acquisition Date, by which satellite the photo is taken,
            location, and other information can be found inside the dataset. The dataset has images
            that contains same fire from different angles and timelines.

    <!-- About Team Section -->
    <section id="about-team">
        <h2>Team</h2>
        <p>
            This project was developed by ADA University students: Ahmad Huseynli, Turgay Farhadli, Gunel Aliyeva, and
            Sahil Guluzada. Their dedication and teamwork ensured the creation of this innovative platform to improve
            wildfire visualization and research capabilities in Azerbaijan.
        </p>
        <p>
            The team specializes in software development, data visualization, and project management, contributing their
            unique skills to deliver this impactful solution. Till now, Ahmad was involved in visualization of the
            database on website,
            Gunel did the data processing part, working with data given by NASA and turning it into usable data. Sahil
            worked on synthetic wildfire
            image creation with phyton for compensating lack of data and website design. Turgay mainly worked on
            creation of model for wildfire detection from satiliste image.

    <!-- About Project Section -->
    <section id="about-project">
        <h2>Project</h2>
        <p>
            The Wildfire Satellite Image Viewer aims to address the lack of tools for wildfire visualization in
            Azerbaijan. It provides users with the ability to filter wildfire images by region, time, satellite type,
            and other criteria. The platform's interactive map and user-friendly design make it a valuable resource for
            researchers, environmentalists, and policymakers.
        </p>
        <p>
            The project combines satellite data analysis, modern web development techniques, and a focus on usability to
            deliver a comprehensive solution for wildfire monitoring and data accessibility.
